<h1>Name</h1>
<b>VMLoginInGuest</b>
<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
$err = VMLoginInGuest($vmHandle,
                      $userName,
                      $password,
                      $options);
</pre>
<p>
This function establishes a guest operating system authentication context
that can be used with guest functions for the given virtual machine handle.
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<dl>
   vmHandle - Identifies a virtual machine. Call VMOpen() to create a virtual machine handle.
   userName - The name of a user account on the guest operating system.
   password - The password of the account identified by userName.
   options - Must be 0 or one of the following values:
<ul>
<li> VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT -
directs guest commands invoked after the call to
</ul>
VMLoginInGuest() to be run from within the session of the
	     user who is interactively logged into the guest operating system. See the remarks
	     below for more information about
	     VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT.
<h1>Return Value</h1>
$err.  The error code returned by the operation. For returned values, see Topics &gt; Error Codes.
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<ul>
<li> This function validates the account name and password in the guest OS. You must 
call this function before calling functions that perform operations on the guest OS,
such as those below.  Otherwise you do not need to call this function.
<li> Logins are supported on Linux and Windows.  To log in as a Windows Domain user,
specify the 'userName' parameter in the form "domain\username".
<li> This function does not respect access permissions on Windows 95, Windows 98, and
Windows ME, due to limitations of the permissions model in those systems.
<li> Other guest operating systems are not supported for login, including Solaris,
FreeBSD, and Netware.
VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT
should be used to ensure that the functions
VMCaptureScreenImage, VMOpenUrlInGuest, and VMRunProgramInGuest
work correctly.
<li> The following functions require that you call VixVM_LoginInGuest():
<ul>
<li> VixVM_RunProgramInGuest()
<li> VixVM_ListProcessesInGuest()
<li> VixVM_KillProcessInGuest()
<li> VixVM_RunScriptInGuest()
<li> VixVM_OpenUrlInGuest()
<li> VixVM_CopyFileFromHostToGuest()
<li> VixVM_CopyFileFromGuestToHost()
<li> VixVM_DeleteFileInGuest()
<li> VixVM_FileExistsInGuest()
<li> VixVM_RenameFileInGuest()
<li> VixVM_CreateTempFileInGuest()
<li> VixVM_ListDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VixVM_CreateDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VixVM_DeleteDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VixVM_DirectoryExistsInGuest()
<li> VixVM_WriteVariable() when writing a VIX_GUEST_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE value.
<li> VixVM_CaptureScreenImage()
</ul>
<li> All guest operations for a particular VM handle are done using the identity
you provide to VixVM_LoginInGuest().  As a result, guest operations are restricted
by file system privileges in the guest OS that apply to the user specified
in VixVM_LoginInGuest().  For example, VixVM_DeleteDirectoryInGuest() might fail
if the user named in VixVM_LoginInGuest() does not have access permissions
to the directory in the guest OS.
<li> VixVM_LoginInGuest() changes the behavior of Vix functions to use a user account.
It does not log a user into a console session on the guest OS. As a result,
you might not see the user logged in from within the guest OS.
Moreover, operations such as rebooting the guest do not clear the guest credentials.
<li> You must call VixVM_LoginInGuest() for each VM handle that uses guest operations.
<li> The virtual machine must be powered on before calling this function.
<li> VMware Tools must be installed and running on the guest OS
before calling this function. You can call VixVM_WaitForToolsInGuest()
to wait for the tools to run.
<li> Once VixVM_LoginInGuest() has succeeded, the user session remains valid until
<ul>
<li> VixVM_LogoutFromGuest() is called successfully,
<li> VixVM_LoginInGuest() is called successfully with different user credentials,
<li> the virtual machine handle's reference count reaches 0, or
<li> the client applications exits.
</ul>
<li> The following functions require that you call VMLoginInGuest():
<ul>
<li> VMRunProgramInGuest()
<li> VMListProcessesInGuest()
<li> VMKillProcessInGuest()
<li> VMRunScriptInGuest()
<li> VMOpenUrlInGuest()
<li> VMCopyFileFromHostToGuest()
<li> VMCopyFileFromGuestToHost()
<li> VMDeleteFileInGuest()
<li> VMFileExistsInGuest()
<li> VMRenameFileInGuest()
<li> VMCreateTempFileInGuest()
<li> VMListDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VMCreateDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VMDeleteDirectoryInGuest()
<li> VMDirectoryExistsInGuest()
<li> VMWriteVariable() when writing a VIX_GUEST_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE value
<li> VMCaptureScreenImage
</ul>
<li> All guest operations for a particular VM handle are done using the identity
you provide to VMLoginInGuest().  As a result, guest operations are restricted
by file system privileges in the guest OS that apply to the user specified
in VMLoginInGuest().  For example, VMDeleteDirectoryInGuest() might fail
if the user named in VMLoginInGuest() does not have access permissions
to the directory in the guest OS.
<li> VMLoginInGuest() changes the behavior of Vix functions to use a user account.
It does not log a user into a console session on the guest OS. As a result,
you might not see the user logged in from within the guest OS.
Moreover, operations such as rebooting the guest do not clear the guest credentials.
<li> You must call VMLoginInGuest() for each VM handle that uses guest operations.
<li> The virtual machine must be powered on before calling this function.
<li> VMware Tools must be installed and running on the guest OS
before calling this function. You can call VMWaitForToolsInGuest()
to wait for the tools to run.
<li> Once VMLoginInGuest() has succeeded, the user session remains valid until
<ul>
<li> VMLogoutFromGuest() is called successfully,
<li> VMLoginInGuest() is called successfully with different user credentials,
<li> the virtual machine handle's reference count reaches 0, or
<li> the client applications exits.
</ul>
<li> The special login type VIX_CONSOLE_USER_NAME is no longer supported.
<li> Calling VixVM_LoginInGuest() with 0 as 'options' can be done at any time
when the VMware Tools are running in the guest.
<li> Calling VixVM_LoginInGuest() with the
VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT flag can only be done when
there is an interactive user logged into the guest OS. Specifically, the
"interactive user" refers to the user who has
logged into the guest OS through the console (for instance, the user who
logged into the Windows log-in screen). The VIX user is the user whose
credentials are being provided in the call to VixVM_LoginInGuest(). With
VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT, there must be an
interactive user logged into the guest when the call to VixVM_LoginInGuest()
is made, and the VIX user must match the interactive user (they must have
same account in the guest OS).
<li> Using VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT will ensure that
the environment in which guest commands are executed is as close as possible
to the normal environment in which a user interacts with the guest OS.
Without VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT, commands
may be run in a more limited environment; however, omitting
VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT will ensure that commands
can be run regardless of whether an interactive user is present in the guest.
<li> On Linux guest operating systems, the
VIX_LOGIN_IN_GUEST_REQUIRE_INTERACTIVE_ENVIRONMENT flag requires that X11
be installed and running.
