<div class="deprecated">This function was removed in version 1.11.</div><h1>Name</h1>
<b>Vix_PumpEvents</b>
<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
void
Vix_PumpEvents(VixHandle hostHandle,
               VixPumpEventsOptions options);
</pre>
<p>
This function is deprecated.  
Vix_PumpEvents
is used in single threaded applications that require
the Vix library to be single threaded.  Tasks that would normally
be executed in a separate thread by the Vix library will be executed
when
Vix_PumpEvents()
is called.
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<dl>
<dt><i>hostHandle</i></dt>
<dd>
The handle to the local host object.
</dd>
<dt><i>options</i></dt>
<dd>
Must be 0.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Return Value</h1>
None.
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<ul>
<li> This function is deprecated and may be removed from future versions of the 
VIX API.
<li> This option is designed for client applications that want to receive
events on only one thread, such as a thread that manages the user
interface. In this case, open the local host handle with the
VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, and call
Vix_PumpEvents()
in the
main event loop. If you fail to call
Vix_PumpEvents(),
Vix asynchronous
actions will not execute.
<li> If you do not open your local host with the
VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, calling
Vix_PumpEvents(),
has no effect.
If you do not open your local host with the
VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, the VIX API creates a small pool of threads for executing
asynchronous operations. Events can be posted from those worker threads, so
your code must be thread-safe.
</ul>
<h1>Side Effects</h1>
None.
<h1>Requirements</h1>
vix.h, since VMware Server 1.0.
