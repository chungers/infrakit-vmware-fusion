<h1>Description</h1>

HRESULT
OpenVM([in] BSTR vmxFilePath,
       [in] ICallback* jobDoneCallback,
       [out,retval] IJob** openJob);
</pre>
<p>
This function opens a virtual machine on the host that is identified by the
hostHandle parameter and returns a context to that machine as a virtual machine handle.
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<dl>
<dt><i>vmxFilePathName</i></dt>
<dd>
The path name of the virtual machine configuration
                     file on the local host.
</dd>
<dt><i>jobDoneCallback</i></dt>
<dd>
An ICallback instance that will be called when the
                  operation is complete.
</dd>
<dt><i>openJob</i></dt>
<dd>
Returns an IJob object that describes the state of this asynchronous operation.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Return Value</h1>
HRESULT
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<ul>
<li> This function opens a virtual machine on the host that is identified by the
hostHandle parameter. The virtual machine is identified by vmxFilePathName,
which is a path name to the configuration file (.VMX file) for that virtual
machine.
<li> The format of the path name depends on the host operating system.
For example, a path name for a Windows host requires backslash as
a directory separator, whereas a Linux host requires a forward slash.
If the path name includes backslash characters, you need to precede each
one with an escape character.  For VMware vSphere (ESX or vCenter Server)
or VMware Server 2.x, the path contains a preceding data store, for
example [storage1] vm/vm.vmx.
<li> This function is asynchronous, and uses a job object to report when the
operation is complete. The function returns a handle to the job object
immediately. When the job is signaled, the virtual machine handle is
stored as the VIX_PROPERTY_JOB_RESULT_HANDLE property of the job object.
<li> Prior to calling host.Disconnect, vm.Close should be called on each
VM retrieved with the VIX_PROPERTY_JOB_RESULT_HANDLE property.
<li> For ESX/ESXi hosts and VMware Server, a virtual machine must be registered before you
can open it. You can register a virtual machine by opening it with the
VMware Server Console, through the vmware-cmd command with the register
parameter, or with 
Host::RegisterVM.
<li> For vSphere, the Virtual Machine opened may not be the one desired
if more than one Datacenter contains vmxFilePathName.
<li> For ESX/ESXi hosts and vSphere, the user account specified in the call to
Host::Connect
must have "System.View" privilege at the level of the Datacenter containing
the ESX server that hosts the VM to be opened.
<li> For ESX/ESXi hosts and vSphere, the user account specified in the call to
Host::Connect
must have sufficient privileges to access guest operations in the virtual 
machine.
For vSphere 4.1 and later, the privilege is "Virtual
Machine.Interaction.Acquire Guest Control Ticket".
For 4.0, the privilege is "Virtual Machine.Interaction.Console Interaction".

<h1>Example</h1>
<pre>
</pre>
VBScript:
<pre>
Dim lib
Dim host
Dim vm
Dim err
Dim results
Dim job

Set lib = CreateObject("VixCOM.VixLib")

' Connect to the local installation of Workstation. This also initializes the VIX API.
Set job = lib.Connect(VixCOM.Constants.VIX_API_VERSION, VixCOM.Constants.VIX_SERVICEPROVIDER_VMWARE_WORKSTATION, Empty, 0, Empty, Empty, 0, Nothing, Nothing)

' results needs to be initialized before it's used, even if it's just going to be overwritten.
Set results = Nothing

' Wait waits until the job started by an asynchronous function call has finished. It also
' can be used to get various properties from the job. The first argument is an array
' of VIX property IDs that specify the properties requested. When Wait returns, the 
' second argument will be set to an array that holds the values for those properties,
' one for each ID requested.
err = job.Wait(Array(VixCOM.Constants.VIX_PROPERTY_JOB_RESULT_HANDLE), results)
If lib.ErrorIndicatesFailure(err) Then
   ' Handle the error...
End If

' The job result handle will be first element in the results array.
Set host = results(0)

' Open the virtual machine with the given .vmx file.
Set job = host.OpenVM("C:\VMs\winxpprowithsp2\winxpprowithsp2.vmx", Nothing)
err = job.Wait(Array(VixCOM.Constants.VIX_PROPERTY_JOB_RESULT_HANDLE), results)
If lib.ErrorIndicatesFailure(err) Then
   ' Handle the error...
End If

Set vm = results(0)

'Execute other commands here

Set results = Nothing
Set job = Nothing
Set vm = Nothing

host.Disconnect()
