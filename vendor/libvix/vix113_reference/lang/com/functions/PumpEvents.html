<div class="deprecated">This function was removed in version 1.11.</div><h1>Name</h1>
<b>PumpEvents</b>
<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
HRESULT
PumpEvents([in] LONG options)
</pre>
<p>
This function is deprecated.  
PumpEvents
is used in single threaded applications that require
the Vix library to be single threaded.  Tasks that would normally
be executed in a separate thread by the Vix library will be executed
when
PumpEvents()
is called.
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<dl>
</dl>
<h1>Return Value</h1>
None.
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<ul>
<li> This function is deprecated and may be removed from future versions of the 
VIX API.
<li> This option is designed for client applications that want to receive
events on only one thread, such as a thread that manages the user
interface. In this case, open the local host handle with the
VixCOM.Constants.VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, and call
PumpEvents()
in the
main event loop. If you fail to call
PumpEvents(),
Vix asynchronous
actions will not execute.
<li> If you do not open your local host with the
VixCOM.Constants.VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, calling
PumpEvents(),
has no effect.
If you do not open your local host with the
VixCOM.Constants.VIX_HOSTOPTION_USE_EVENT_PUMP
option, the VIX API creates a small pool of threads for executing
asynchronous operations. Events can be posted from those worker threads, so
your code must be thread-safe.
</ul>
<h1>Side Effects</h1>
None.
<h1>Requirements</h1>
VixCOM.h, since VMware Workstation 6.0.
